# Fract'ol  42

## Overview

A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over

## Features
* Render different fractals: mandelbrot, julia, burning ship
* Different color schemes (rotated and linear)
* Smooth and linear coloring

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Runs on OS X and Linux.
Run it with `./fractol [fractal]`. Possible fractals are: `mandelbrot`, `julia`,
`burningship`.
